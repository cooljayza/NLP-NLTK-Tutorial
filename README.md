# NLP-NLTK-Tutorial
NLTK NLP Tutorial implemented using sklearn


As I was busy with a tutorial on the nltk website. I found myself getting confused with their API espcially since I had previously used the sklearn package. This inspired me to rewrite their tutorial using the sklearn packacge. Please note that this is not the complete tutorial. I will keep updating as I work through more tutorials.


Enjoy
